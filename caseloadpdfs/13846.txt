Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990
Report of Motions Pending More Than Six Months, Bench Trials Submitted More Than Six Months, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending More Than Six Months, Social Security Appeal Cases Pending More Than Six Months, and Civil Cases Pending More Than Three Years on
March 31, 2010
Introduction
The Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 (CJRA) requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO), under 28 U.S.C. §476, to prepare a semiannual report showing, by U.S. district judge and magistrate judge, all motions pending more than six months, all bench trials that have remained undecided more than six months, and all civil cases pending more than three years. The reporting requirements under the CJRA are designed to help reduce both costs and delays in civil litigation in the district courts. The information also may be used to evaluate demands on the district courts' resources.
This is the 38th semiannual report prepared pursuant to the CJRA that shows all motions in civil cases pending more than six months, civil bench trials submitted more than six months, and civil cases pending more than three years. In accordance with the Judicial Conference mandates of 1998, this report also presents data on bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months and Social Security appeal cases pending more than six months.
The CJRA report is prepared primarily by automated means through the use of the Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF) System. As a result, pending motions, bench trials, three-year-old cases, bankruptcy appeals, and Social Security appeal cases are being reported in a standardized and consistent fashion, and all judges using these systems have the most accurate tools to help them prepare semiannual reports.
Appendix A provides data for each U.S. district judge and U.S. magistrate judge on motions pending, bench trials submitted, cases pending, bankruptcy appeals pending, and Social Security appeal cases pending. The CJRA requires the AO Director to establish uniform standards for determining when a motion, bench trial, case, or bankruptcy appeal is "pending"; Appendix B lists these definitions.
Along with the semiannual consolidated national report, the AO has prepared a supplemental report, A Report on Motions Pending for More Than Six Months, Bench Trials Submitted for more Than Six Months, Civil Cases Pending Three Years or More, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending for More Than Six Months, and Social Security Appeal Cases Pending for More Than Six Months on March 31, 2010, that provides detailed information regarding the individual cases, motions, bench trials, and appeals pending in the U.S. district courts. This document is available to the public through the U.S. district courts, the executive offices of the U.S. courts of appeals, the AO, and the Federal Judiciary website at www.uscourts.gov.
Report Findings
The information in this report presents what may best be described as a "snapshot" of motions pending more than six months, bench trials submitted more than six months, civil cases pending more than three years, and bankruptcy appeals and Social Security appeal
1

cases pending more than six months on March 31, 2010. District judge and magistrate judge caseloads change constantly, so many of the matters pending on March 31, 2010, have since been decided or transferred to other judges. Those using reports of this type thus should take into account the state of change in the district courts' pending caseloads.
Although the information provided in this report pertains to the pending civil caseload of district judges and magistrate judges, readers should take into consideration the overall case processing demands placed on the courts by both civil and criminal matters. An accurate assessment of the demands placed on the district courts also requires consideration of numerous factors, including vacant judgeships and the effects of all cases making up each court's caseload.
Methodology
This national report is designed to place special emphasis on detailed analyses that are extracted from the national CM/ECF system or obtained by other automated means. Each U.S. district court is required to analyze the reasons for delays in disposing of pending motions, bench trials, three-year-old cases, bankruptcy appeals, and Social Security appeal cases. Judges use status codes to provide reasons for delays in these matters (see Appendix C). More specific information about motions pending, bench trials submitted, and cases pending on September 30, 2009, and March 31, 2010, appears in the accompanying tables.
Numbers of Motions Pending, Bench Trials Submitted, Cases Pending, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending, and Social Security Appeal Cases Pending on March 31, 2010.
Motions. The total number of motions pending more than six months for all district judges and magistrate judges fell 9 percent (down 509 motions) from 5,788 on September 30, 2009, to 5,279 on March 31, 2010. Ninety-one percent of all motions pending were before district judges, and 9 percent were before magistrate judges.
For the March 31, 2010, CJRA report, eight circuits reported decreases in pending motions, and four circuits reported increases. The most substantial reductions in pending motions occurred in the Second Circuit (down 306 motions) and Sixth Circuit (down 129 motions), with declines involving a variety of case types. In the Second Circuit, five districts reported declines in total motions, including a drop of 164 motions in the Southern District of New York. In the Sixth Circuit, six districts reported lower numbers of motions. In addition to the larger declines in the Second Circuit and Sixth Circuit, decreases of more than 50 motions in multiple types of cases were reported by the First Circuit (down 77 motions), the Ninth Circuit (down 76 motions), the Eleventh Circuit (down 62 motions), and the Tenth Circuit (down 57 motions).
Primary Reasons for Delays in Pending Motions. District courts provided one or more status codes for each of the 5,279 pending motions reported on March 31, 2010 (see Appendix C). The primary reasons provided were opinion/decision in draft (1,510 motions), complexity of case (685 motions), heavy criminal and civil caseload (585 motions), and referred to magistrate judge (521 motions).
Primary Nature of Suit Codes in Pending Motions. The majority of the nature of suit codes provided by district courts for pending motions (see Appendix D) for March 31, 2010, were civil rights (1,252 motions), prisoner petitions (1,127 motions), and contract (817 motions).

Bench Trials. The total number of bench trials pending more than six months for all district judges and magistrate judges fell 14 percent from 78 on September 30, 2009, to 67 on March 31, 2010. Pending bench trials in various types of civil cases declined in 6 of the 12 circuits, increased in 5 circuits, and remained unchanged in 1 circuit. The Third Circuit reported five fewer bench trials, with the District of Delaware reporting four fewer than in the previous reporting period.
Primary Reasons for Delays in Pending Bench Trials. District courts provided one or more status codes for each of the 67 pending bench trials to indicate reasons for delays. The primary reasons were opinion/decision in draft (40 trials), voluminous brief/transcripts to be read (13 trials), and complexity of case (13 trials).
Primary Nature of Suit Codes in Pending Bench Trials. The nature of suit codes used most often for pending bench trials were contract (15 trials), personal injury (12 trials), intellectual property rights (12 trials), and civil rights (11 trials).
Three-Year-Old Cases. The number of civil cases pending more than three years grew 22 percent from 21,290 on September 30, 2009, to 25,995 (up 4,705 cases) on March 31, 2010. District judges reported 99 percent of all pending three-year-old cases, and magistrate judges reported the remaining 1 percent. Three-year-old cases rose in 7 of the 12 circuits. The most significant increases occurred in the Second Circuit (up 5,299 cases), Eighth Circuit (up 455 cases), and Seventh Circuit (up 117 cases). In the Second Circuit, the three-year-old caseload in the Southern District of New York climbed by 5,473 cases, most of them related to the terrorist-related aircraft crashes on September 11, 2001. In the Eighth Circuit, a continuing personal injury multidistrict litigation case related to hormone replacement therapy caused the pending caseload in the Eastern District of Arkansas to grow by 331 cases. In the Seventh Circuit, the Northern District of Illinois reported an increase of 146 three-year-old cases of multiple types.

Primary Reasons for Delays in Pending Three-Year-Old Cases. District courts provided one or more status codes for all 25,995 three-year-old cases to indicate the reasons for delays. The vast majority of status codes used were multidistrict litigation (10,652 cases), complexity of case (9,301 cases), and referred to magistrate judge (1,283 cases).
Primary Nature of Suit Codes In Pending Three-Year-Old Cases. The nature of suit codes used most often for pending three-year-old cases were personal injury (18,477 cases), prisoner petitions (2,179 petitions), civil rights (1,397 cases), and contract (802 cases).
Bankruptcy Appeals. Bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months jumped 20 percent from 137 on September 30, 2009, to 164 on March 31, 2010, and all pending bankruptcy appeals were reported by district judges. Growth occurred in 6 of the 12 circuits, declines occurred in 4 circuits, and the totals remained unchanged in 2 circuits. Three circuits reported 77 percent of all pending bankruptcy appeals (127 appeals): the Ninth Circuit (59 appeals), Second Circuit (52 appeals), and Third Circuit (16 appeals). These increases are attributed, in part, to growth in bankruptcy petitions during the recession.
Primary Reasons for Delays in Pending Bankruptcy Appeals. District courts provided one or more status codes for each of the 164 pending bankruptcy appeals to indicate the reasons for delays. The codes used most often were complexity of case (34 appeals), opinion/ decision in draft (31 appeals), and awaiting materials (29 appeals).
Social Security Appeal Cases. Social Security appeal cases pending more than six months fell 6 percent (down 33 cases) from 529 on September 30, 2009, to 496 on March 31, 2010. District judges reported 75 percent of these cases, and magistrate judges reported 25 percent. Six of the 12 circuits had reductions, 4 had increases, and 2 had no changes. Decreases in the Second Circuit (down 31 cases) and Fourth Circuit (down 30 cases) were primarily responsible for the national decline in pending Social Security appeal cases. The Northern District of New York and the Western District of New York disposed of 21 and 10 pending cases, respectively. In the Fourth Circuit, three magistrate judges in

Appendix B. Definitions
All active and senior district court judges, as well as all full-time and part-time magistrate judges, must report pending matters. Detailed guidelines for making reports under the CJRA on pending motions, bench trials, and cases appear in the AO's Guide to Judiciary Policy; see Volume 18 (Statistics, Chapter 5 of Appendix 5C). Several issues relevant to the reporting of cases pending for more than three years include the following.
· With respect to cases pending for more than three years that have been assigned to district judges and magistrate judges from outside the districts where the cases originated, such cases are included in the totals for the districts where they were filed initially. Sometimes a block of cases or a class of cases that are similar in nature is assigned to a single judge. Such cases often require lengthy litigation when they involve complex issues and large numbers of parties.
· This report includes some asbestos cases. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) authorized the transfer of most of the pending asbestos personal injury/product liability cases to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under Order Number 875. Asbestos cases that have remained in the districts where they were filed originally or that were transferred back to the original districts are included in this report. However, those cases transferred according to MDL Docket 875 are excluded. All other MDL cases are included in this report.
Cases Pending More Than Three Years. The CJRA requires a report, by district judge and magistrate judge, of cases pending more than three years in the district courts. A case becomes pending as of the date the case originally was filed in the district court or the date the case was reopened, whichever is later. If a case has not been disposed of within three years after its filing date or reopening date, the case shall be reported as pending more than three years.
Motions Pending More Than Six Months. The CJRA mandates a report enumerating all motions that have been pending six months or longer. A motion is a request made to a district judge or magistrate judge for an order, ruling, or similar determination. The opposing party has 30 days from the date of a motion's filing to respond to it. A motion becomes pending 30 days after the date it was filed or was referred to a magistrate judge, whichever is later. If no decision on a motion has been filed within six months after the date the motion became pending, and the motion has not been referred to a magistrate judge, the motion shall be reported as pending more than six months before the presiding judge. If a motion is referred to a magistrate judge, the magistrate judge must file a report and make a recommendation for, or dispose of, the motion within six months after the date the motion became pending, or the motion shall be reported as pending for both the district judge and the magistrate judge.
Bench Trials Submitted More than Six Months. The CJRA requires the AO to prepare a report of bench trials submitted more than six months. In a bench trial, the judge (rather than a jury) decides the facts of the case. A bench trial is considered to be submitted on the date the courtroom proceedings are concluded. If a judge fails to file an opinion within six months after a bench trial was submitted, the bench trial shall be reported as submitted more than six months.
Bankruptcy Appeals Pending More Than Six Months. In accordance with an action of the March 1998 Judicial Conference, the CJRA now requires a report, by district judge and magistrate judge, of bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months in the district courts. A bankruptcy appeal becomes pending as of the date the appeal originally was filed in the district court or the date the case was re-
57

opened, whichever is later. If an appeal has not been disposed of within six months plus 60 days after its filing date or reopening date, the appeal shall be reported as pending more than six months.
Social Security Appeal Cases Pending More Than Six Months. In accordance with an action of the September 1998 Judicial Conference, the CJRA now requires a report, by district judge and magistrate judge, of Social Security appeal cases pending more than six months in the district courts. A Social Security appeal case becomes pending as of the date of the filing of the latest transcript in such case. If a case has not been disposed of within six months plus 120 days after its filing date, the case shall be reported as pending more than six months.
