Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990
Report of Motions Pending More Than Six Months, Bench Trials Submitted More Than Six Months, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending More Than Six Months, Social Security Appeal Cases Pending More Than Six Months, and Civil Cases Pending More Than Three Years on
September 30, 2010
Introduction
The Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 (CJRA) requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO), under 28 U.S.C. §476, to prepare a semiannual report showing, by U.S. district judge and magistrate judge, all motions pending more than six months, all bench trials that have remained undecided more than six months, and all civil cases pending more than three years. The reporting requirements under the CJRA are designed to help reduce both costs and delays in civil litigation in the district courts. The information also may be used to evaluate demands on the district courts' resources.
This is the 39th semiannual report prepared pursuant to the CJRA that shows all motions in civil cases pending more than six months, civil bench trials submitted more than six months, and civil cases pending more than three years. In accordance with the Judicial Conference mandates of 1998, this report also presents data on bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months and Social Security appeal cases pending more than six months.
The CJRA report is prepared primarily by automated means through the use of the Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF) System. As a result, pending motions, bench trials, three-year-old cases, bankruptcy appeals, and Social Security appeal cases are being reported in a standardized and consistent fashion, and all judges using these systems have the most accurate tools to help them prepare semiannual reports.
Appendix A provides data for each U.S. district judge and U.S. magistrate judge on civil cases pending, motions pending, bench trials submitted, bankruptcy appeals pending, and Social Security appeal cases pending. The CJRA requires the AO Director to establish uniform standards for determining when a motion, bench trial, case, or bankruptcy appeal is "pending"; Appendix B lists these definitions. Status codes for civil cases pending, motions pending, bench trials submitted, bankruptcy appeals pending, and Social Security appeal cases pending appear in Appendix C. The nature of suit codes for types of civil litigation appear in Appendix D.
Along with the semiannual consolidated national report, the AO has prepared a supplemental report, A Report on Motions Pending for More Than Six Months, Bench Trials Submitted for More Than Six Months, Civil Cases Pending Three Years or More, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending for More Than Six Months, and Social Security Appeal Cases Pending for More Than Six Months on September 30, 2010, that provides detailed information regarding the individual cases, motions, bench trials, and appeals pending in the U.S. district courts. This document is available to the public through the U.S. district courts, the executive offices of the U.S. courts of appeals, the AO, and the Federal Judiciary website at www.uscourts.gov.

Report Findings
The information in this report presents what may best be described as a "snapshot" of motions pending more than six months, bench trials submitted more than six months, civil cases pending more than three years, bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months, and Social Security appeal cases pending more than six months on September 30, 2010. District judge and magistrate judge caseloads change constantly, so many of the matters pending on September 30, 2010, have since been decided or transferred to other judges. Therefore, those using reports of this type should take into account the state of change in the district courts' pending caseloads.
Although the information provided in this report pertains to the pending civil caseload of district judges and magistrate judges, readers should take into consideration the overall case processing demands placed on the courts by both civil and criminal matters. An accurate assessment of the demands placed on the district courts also requires consideration of numerous factors, including vacant judgeships and the effects of all cases making up each court's caseload.
Methodology
This national report is designed to place special emphasis on detailed analyses that are extracted from the national CM/ECF system or obtained by other automated means. Each U.S. district court is required to analyze the reasons for delays in disposing of pending civil cases, motions, bench trials, bankruptcy appeals, and Social Security appeal cases. Judges use status codes to provide reasons for delays in these matters (see Appendix C). More specific information about motions pending, bench trials submitted, and cases pending on March 31, 2010, and September 30, 2010, appear in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Numbers of Civil Cases Pending, Motions Pending, Bench Trials Submitted, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending, and Social Security Appeal Cases Pending on September 30, 2010.
Civil Cases. The number of civil cases pending more than three years decreased 5 percent from 25,995 on March 31, 2010, to 24,641 (down 1,354 cases) on September 30, 2010. District judges reported 99 percent of all pending three-year-old cases, and magistrate judges reported the remaining 1 percent. Three-year-old cases fell in 5 of the 12 circuits. The most significant reductions occurred in the Fifth Circuit (down 1,947 cases) and the Sixth Circuit (down 269 cases). In the Fifth Circuit, the three-year-old caseload in the Eastern District of Louisiana dropped by 1,959 cases, mostly because of declines in personal injury/product liability suits alleging injuries from the drug Vioxx. In the Sixth Circuit, three-year-old cases in the Northern District of Ohio decreased by 347 cases, mostly because that district had fewer multidistrict litigation cases related to welding rods.
Primary Reasons for Delays in Pending Three-Year-Old Cases. District courts provided status codes for all 24,641 three-year-old cases to indicate the reasons for delays (see Appendix C). The vast majority of status codes used fell into the following 5 categories: complexity of case (10,025 cases), multidistrict litigation case (8,777 cases), referred to magistrate judge (1,214 cases), trial scheduled (925 cases), and settlement pending (763 cases).
Primary Nature of Suit Codes In Pending Three-Year-Old Cases. The following 5 nature of suit codes (see Appendix D) were used most often for pending three-year-old cases for

September 30, 2010: personal injury/product liability (17,145 cases), prisoner petitions (2,117 petitions), civil rights (1,403 cases), contract (813 cases), and other statutory actions (636 cases).
Motions. The number of motions pending more than six months for all district judges and magistrate judges fell 7 percent (down 366 motions) from 5,279 on March 31, 2010, to 4,913 on September 30, 2010. Ninety-two percent of all motions pending were before district judges, and 8 percent were before magistrate judges.
For the September 30, 2010, CJRA report, pending motions decreased in seven circuits, increased in four, and remained the same in one. The most substantial reductions in pending motions occurred in the Third Circuit (down 175 motions), the Fourth Circuit (down170 motions), and the Fifth Circuit (down 126 motions). In the Third Circuit, four of the six district courts reported reductions in motions in multiple types of civil cases. In the Fourth Circuit, five of the nine district courts reported decreases in pending motions. In the Fifth Circuit, all nine district courts reported declines.
Primary Reasons for Delays in Pending Motions. District courts provided status codes for each of the 4,913 motions reported on September 30, 2010. Almost two-thirds of these codes were in the following 5 categories: opinion/decision in draft (1,260 motions), complexity of case (570 motions), heavy criminal and civil caseload (486 motions), referred to magistrate judge (463 motions), and voluminous brief/transcripts to be read (435 motions).
Primary Nature of Suit Codes in Pending Motions. The majority of the nature of suit codes provided by district courts for pending motions for September 30, 2010, were for the following 5 types of civil cases: civil rights (1,264 motions), prisoner petitions (975 motions), contract (676 motions), torts (541 motions), and labor (265 motions).
Bench Trials. The total number of bench trials pending more than six months for all district judges and magistrate judges declined from 67 on March 31, 2010, to 58 on September 30, 2010. Pending bench trials in various types of civil cases declined in 6 of the 12 circuits, rose in 3 circuits, and remained unchanged in 3 circuits.

Appendix B. Definitions
All active and senior district court judges, as well as all full-time and part-time magistrate judges, must report pending matters. Detailed guidelines for making reports under the CJRA on pending motions, bench trials, and cases appear in the AO's Guide to Judiciary Policy; see Volume 18 (Statistics, Chapter 5 of Appendix 5C). Several issues relevant to the reporting of cases pending for more than three years include the following.
· With respect to cases pending for more than three years that have been assigned to district judges and magistrate judges from outside the districts where the cases originated, such cases are included in the totals for the districts where they were filed initially. Sometimes a block of cases or a class of cases that are similar in nature is assigned to a single judge. Such cases often require lengthy litigation when they involve complex issues and large numbers of parties.
· This report includes some asbestos cases. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) authorized the transfer of most of the pending asbestos personal injury/product liability cases to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under Order Number 875. Asbestos cases that have remained in the districts where they were filed originally or that were transferred back to the original districts are included in this report. However, those cases transferred according to MDL Docket 875 are excluded. All other MDL cases are included in this report.
Cases Pending More Than Three Years. The CJRA requires a report, by district judge and magistrate judge, of cases pending more than three years in the district courts. A case becomes pending as of the date the case originally was filed in the district court or the date the case was reopened, whichever is later. If a case has not been disposed of within three years after its filing date or reopening date, the case shall be reported as pending more than three years.
Motions Pending More Than Six Months. The CJRA mandates a report enumerating all motions that have been pending six months or longer. A motion is a request made to a district judge or magistrate judge for an order, ruling, or similar determination. The opposing party has 30 days from the date of a motion's filing to respond to it. A motion becomes pending 30 days after the date it was filed or was referred to a magistrate judge, whichever is later. If no decision on a motion has been filed within six months after the date the motion became pending, and the motion has not been referred to a magistrate judge, the motion shall be reported as pending more than six months before the presiding judge. If a motion is referred to a magistrate judge, the magistrate judge must file a report and make a recommendation for, or dispose of, the motion within six months after the date the motion became pending, or the motion shall be reported as pending for both the district judge and the magistrate judge.
Bench Trials Submitted More than Six Months. The CJRA requires the AO to prepare a report of bench trials submitted more than six months. In a bench trial, the judge (rather than a jury) decides the facts of the case. A bench trial is considered to be submitted on the date the courtroom proceedings are concluded. If a judge fails to file an opinion within six months after a bench trial was submitted, the bench trial shall be reported as submitted more than six months.

Bankruptcy Appeals Pending More Than Six Months. In accordance with an action of the March 1998 Judicial Conference, the CJRA now requires a report, by district judge and magistrate judge, of bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months in the district courts. A bankruptcy appeal becomes pending as of the date the appeal originally was filed in the district court or the date the case was reopened, whichever is later. If an appeal has not been disposed of within six months plus 60 days after its filing date or reopening date, the appeal shall be reported as pending more than six months.
Social Security Appeal Cases Pending More Than Six Months. In accordance with an action of the September 1998 Judicial Conference, the CJRA now requires a report, by district judge and mag-
