Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990
Report of Motions Pending More Than Six Months, Bench Trials Submitted More Than Six Months, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending More Than Six Months, Social Security Appeal Cases Pending More Than Six Months, and Civil Cases Pending More Than Three Years on
March 31, 2012
Introduction
The Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 (CJRA) requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO), under 28 U.S.C. § 476, to prepare a semiannual report showing, by U.S. district judge and U.S. magistrate judge, all motions pending more than six months, all bench trials that have remained undecided more than six months, and all civil cases pending more than three years. The reporting requirements under the CJRA are designed to help reduce both costs and delays in civil litigation in the district courts. The information also may be used to evaluate demands on the district courts' resources.
This is the 42nd semiannual report prepared pursuant to the CJRA that shows all motions in civil cases pending more than six months, civil bench trials submitted more than six months, and civil cases pending more than three years. In accordance with the Judicial Conference mandates of 1998, this report also presents data on bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months and Social Security appeal cases pending more than six months.
The CJRA report is prepared by automated means through the use of the Case Management/Electronic Case Files System (CM/ECF). As a result, pending motions, bench trials, three-year-old cases, bankruptcy appeals, and Social Security appeal cases are reported in a standardized and consistent fashion, and all judges using these systems have tools to help them prepare accurate semiannual reports.
Appendix A provides data for each district judge and magistrate judge on motions pending, bench trials submitted, cases pending more than three years, bankruptcy appeals pending, and Social Security appeal cases pending. The CJRA requires the AO Director to establish uniform standards for determining when a motion, bench trial, case, or bankruptcy appeal is "pending"; Appendix B lists these definitions.
Along with the semiannual consolidated national report, the AO has prepared a supplemental report, A Report on Motions Pending for More Than Six Months, Bench Trials Submitted for More Than Six Months, Civil Cases Pending Three Years or More, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending for More Than Six Months, and Social Security Appeal Cases Pending for More Than Six Months on March 31, 2012, that provides detailed information regarding the individual cases, motions, bench trials, and appeals pending in the district courts. This document is available to the public through the district courts, the executive offices of the U.S. courts of appeals, the AO, and the Federal Judiciary website at www.uscourts.gov.
Report Findings
The information in this report presents what may best be described as a "snapshot" of motions pending more than six months, bench trials submitted more than six months, civil cases pending more than three years, bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months,
1

and Social Security appeal cases pending more than six months on March 31, 2012. District judge and magistrate judge caseloads change constantly, so many of the matters pending on March 31, 2012, have since been decided or transferred to other judges. Therefore, persons using reports of this type should take into account the state of change in the district courts' pending caseloads.
Although the information provided in this report pertains to the pending civil caseload of district judges and magistrate judges, readers should take into consideration the overall case processing demands placed on the courts by both civil and criminal matters. An accurate assessment of the demands placed on the district courts also requires consideration of numerous factors, including vacant judgeships and the effects of all cases making up each court's caseload.
Methodology
This national report is designed to place special emphasis on detailed analyses that are extracted from the national CM/ECF system or obtained by other automated means. Each district court is required to analyze the reasons for delays in disposing of motions, bench trials, three-year-old cases, bankruptcy appeals, and Social Security appeal cases. Judges use status codes to provide reasons for delays in these matters (see Appendix C). The nature of suit codes for types of civil litigation appear in Appendix D. More specific information about cases pending, motions pending, bench trials submitted, bankruptcy appeals pending, and Social Security appeal cases pending on September 30, 2011, and March 31, 2012, appears in the Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Numbers of Motions Pending, Bench Trials Submitted, Civil Cases Pending, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending, and Social Security Appeal Cases Pending on March 31, 2012.
Motions. The total number of motions pending more than six months for all district judges and magistrate judges rose 4 percent (up by 192 motions) from 5,066 on September 30, 2011, to 5,253 on March 31, 2012. Ninety percent of all motions pending were before district judges, and 10 percent were before magistrate judges.
For the March 31, 2012, CJRA report, seven circuits reported increases in pending motions, and five circuits reported declines. The greatest growth in pending motions occurred in the Fifth Circuit, which had 155 more motions; the Fourth Circuit, which had 93 more motions; the First Circuit, which had 81 more motions; and the Third Circuit, which had 62 more motions. Each of these circuits reported that its increase primarily resulted from new motions filed in civil cases of various types.
Primary Reasons for Delays in Pending Motions. District courts provided one or more status codes to indicate primary reasons for delays for each of the 5,253 pending motions reported for March 31, 2012. The status codes cited most often were opinion/decision in draft (1,441 motions), complexity of case (715 motions), heavy criminal and civil caseload (713 motions), referred to magistrate judge (602 motions), and voluminous briefs/ transcripts to be read (474 motions).
Primary Nature of Suit Codes in Pending Motions. The primary nature of suit codes provided most often by district courts were civil rights (1,241 motions), prisoner petitions (1,066 motions), and contracts (781 motions).
Bench Trials. The total number of bench trials pending more than six months for all district judges and magistrate judges increased by 7 from six months earlier to 71. Six of the 12 circuits reported increases in bench trials, with the Second Circuit, Third Circuit, Fifth

Circuit, Seventh Circuit, and Ninth Circuit each reporting seven or more pending bench trials. Five circuits had decreases in pending bench trials. The total for one circuit remained unchanged.
Primary Reasons for Delays in Pending Bench Trials. District courts provided one or more status codes to indicate the primary reasons for delays for each of the 71 pending bench trials reported for March 31, 2012. The status codes cited most often were opinion/ decision in draft (49 trials), voluminous briefs/transcripts to be read (14 trials), and complexity of case (14 trials).
Primary Nature of Suit Codes in Pending Bench Trials. The primary nature of suit codes provided most often for pending bench trials were contract (15 trials), labor (11 trials), civil rights (10 trials), and intellectual property rights (9 trials).
Civil Cases. The number of civil cases pending more than three years rose 2 percent (up by 343 cases) from 18,454 on September 30, 2011, to 18,797 on March 31, 2012. District judges reported 98 percent of all pending three-year-old cases, and magistrate judges reported the remaining 2 percent. Three-year-old cases increased in 7 of the 12 circuits. The largest growth occurred in the First Circuit, which had 272 more pending cases, and the Eighth Circuit, which had 176 more pending cases. Both of these circuits attributed their higher pending caseloads to multidistrict litigation related to personal injury/product liability cases.
Primary Reasons for Delays in Pending Civil Cases. District courts provided one or more status codes to indicate reasons for delays for all 18,797 civil cases reported for March 31, 2012. The status codes cited most often were multidistrict litigation (10,237 cases), complexity of case (2,988 cases), referred to magistrate judge (989 cases), extensive discovery involved (898 cases), trial scheduled (883 cases), awaiting materials (791 cases), opinion/decision in draft (639 cases), and set for status conference (511 cases).

Appendix B. Definitions
All active and senior district court judges, as well as all full-time and part-time magistrate judges, must report pending matters. Detailed guidelines for making reports under the CJRA on pending motions, bench trials, and cases appear in the AO's Guide to Judiciary Policy; see Volume 18 (Statistics, Chapter 5 of Appendix 5C). Several issues relevant to the reporting of cases pending for more than three years include the following.
· With respect to cases pending for more than three years that have been assigned to district judges and magistrate judges from outside the districts where the cases originated, such cases are included in the totals for the districts where they were filed initially. Sometimes a block of cases or a class of cases that are similar in nature is assigned to a single judge. Such cases often require lengthy litigation when they involve complex issues and large numbers of parties.
· This report includes some asbestos cases. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) authorized the transfer of most of the pending asbestos personal injury/product liability cases to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under Order Number 875. Asbestos cases that have remained in the districts where they were filed originally or that were transferred back to the original districts are included in this report. However, those cases transferred according to MDL Docket 875 are excluded. All other MDL cases are included in this report.
Cases Pending More Than Three Years. The CJRA requires a report, by district judge and magistrate judge, of cases pending more than three years in the district courts. A case becomes pending as of the date the case originally was filed in the district court or the date the case was reopened, whichever is later. If a case has not been disposed of within three years after its filing date or reopening date, the case shall be reported as pending more than three years.
Motions Pending More Than Six Months. The CJRA mandates a report enumerating all motions that have been pending six months or longer. A motion is a request made to a district judge or magistrate judge for an order, ruling, or similar determination. The opposing party has 30 days from the date of a motion's filing to respond to it. A motion becomes pending 30 days after the date it was filed or was referred to a magistrate judge, whichever is later. If no decision on a motion has been filed within six months after the date the motion became pending, and the motion has not been referred to a magistrate judge, the motion shall be reported as pending more than six months before the presiding judge. If a motion is referred to a magistrate judge, the magistrate judge must file a report and make a recommendation for, or dispose of, the motion within six months after the date the motion became pending, or the motion shall be reported as pending for both the district judge and the magistrate judge.
Bench Trials Submitted More than Six Months. The CJRA requires the AO to prepare a report of bench trials submitted more than six months. In a bench trial, the judge (rather than a jury) decides the facts of the case. A bench trial is considered to be submitted on the date the courtroom proceedings are concluded. If a judge fails to file an opinion within six months after a bench trial was submitted, the bench trial shall be reported as submitted more than six months.
64

Bankruptcy Appeals Pending More Than Six Months. In accordance with an action of the March 1998 Judicial Conference, the CJRA now requires a report, by district judge and magistrate judge, of bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months in the district courts. A bankruptcy appeal becomes pending as of the date the appeal originally was filed in the district court or the date the case was reopened, whichever is later. If an appeal has not been disposed of within six months plus 60 days after its filing date or reopening date, the appeal shall be reported as pending more than six months.
Social Security Appeal Cases Pending More Than Six Months. In accordance with an action of the September 1998 Judicial Conference, the CJRA now requires a report, by district judge and magistrate judge, of Social Security appeal cases pending more than six months in the district courts. A Social Security appeal case becomes pending as of the date of the filing of the latest transcript in such case. If a case has not been disposed of within six months plus 120 days after its filing date, the case shall be reported as pending more than six months.
