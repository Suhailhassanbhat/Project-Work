Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990
Report of Motions Pending More Than Six Months, Bench Trials Submitted More Than Six Months, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending More Than Six Months, Social Security Appeal Cases Pending More Than Six Months, and Civil Cases Pending More Than Three Years on
March 31, 2014
Introduction
The Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 (CJRA) requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO), under 28 U.S.C. § 476, to prepare a semiannual report showing, by U.S. district judge and U.S. magistrate judge, all motions pending more than six months, all bench trials that have remained undecided more than six months, and all civil cases pending more than three years. In accordance with the Judicial Conference policy, this report also presents data on bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months and Social Security appeals pending more than six months. The reporting requirements under the CJRA are designed to help reduce both costs and delays in civil litigation in the district courts. The information also may be used to evaluate demands on the district courts' resources.
The CJRA report is prepared through the use of the Case Management/Electronic Case Files System (CM/ECF). As a result, pending motions, bench trials, threeyear-old cases, bankruptcy appeals, and Social Security appeals are reported in a standardized and consistent fashion.
Appendix A provides data for each district judge and magistrate judge on motions pending, bench trials submitted, cases pending more than three years, bankruptcy appeals pending, and Social Security appeals pending. The CJRA requires the AO Director to establish uniform standards for determining when a motion, bench trial, case, or bankruptcy appeal is "pending"; Appendix B lists these definitions.
Along with the semiannual consolidated national report, the AO prepares a supplemental report, A Report on Motions Pending for More Than Six Months, Bench Trials Submitted for More Than Six Months, Civil Cases Pending Three Years or More, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending for More Than Six Months, and Social Security Appeals Pending for More Than Six Months, that provides detailed information regarding the individual cases, motions, bench trials, and appeals pending in the district courts. This document is available to the public through the district courts, the executive offices of the U.S. courts of appeals, and the Federal Judiciary website www.uscourts.gov.
Report Findings
The information in this report presents what may best be described as a "snapshot" of motions pending more than six months, bench trials submitted more than six months, civil cases pending more than three years, bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months, and Social Security appeals pending more than six months on
1

March 31, 2014. District judge and magistrate judge caseloads change constantly, so many of the matters pending on March 31, 2014, have since been decided or transferred to other judges. Therefore, persons using reports of this type should take into account the state of change in the district courts' pending caseloads.
Although the information provided in this report pertains to the pending civil caseload of district judges and magistrate judges, readers should take into consideration the overall case processing demands placed on the courts by both civil and criminal matters. An accurate assessment of the demands placed on the district courts also requires consideration of numerous factors, including vacant judgeships and the complexity of all cases making up each court's caseload.
Methodology
This national report is designed to place special emphasis on detailed analyses that are extracted from the national CM/ECF system. Each district court is required to analyze the reasons for delays in disposing of motions, bench trials, three-year-old cases, bankruptcy appeals, and Social Security appeals. Judges use status codes to provide reasons for delays in these matters (see Appendix C). The nature of suit codes for types of civil litigation appear in Appendix D. More specific information about cases pending, motions pending, bench trials submitted, bankruptcy appeals pending, and Social Security appeals pending on September 30, 2013 and March 31, 2014, appears in the Tables 1 through 4.
Numbers of Motions Pending, Bench Trials Submitted, Civil Cases Pending, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending, and Social Security Appeals Pending on March 31, 2014.
Motions. The total number of motions pending more than six months for all district judges and magistrate judges rose 1 percent (up 39 motions) from 5,476 on September 30, 2013, to 5,515 on March 31, 2014. Ninety-one percent of all motions pending were before district judges, and 9 percent were before magistrate judges.
For the March 31, 2014, CJRA report, four circuits reported increases in pending motions, and eight circuits reported decreases. The largest increase in pending motions occurred in the Tenth Circuit (up 209 motions), followed by the Fifth Circuit (up 85 motions), the District of Columbia Circuit (up 55 motions), and the Ninth Circuit (up 47 motions). In the Tenth Circuit, additional motions in various types of civil cases were reported by the District of Colorado (up 108 motions) and the District of New Mexico (up 107 motions). In the Fifth Circuit, motions in multiple judges' caseloads increased in seven of the nine district courts. In the District of Columbia Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, the circuit-wide increases resulted from new motions in various types of civil cases.
Primary Reasons for Delays in Pending Motions. District courts provided one or more status codes to indicate primary reasons for delays for each of the 5,515 pending motions reported for March 31, 2014. The status codes cited most often were opinion/decision in draft (1,635 motions), complexity of case (859 motions), heavy criminal and civil caseload (740 motions), voluminous briefs/transcripts to be read (607 motions), referred to magistrate judge (435 motions), and awaiting materials (328 motions).

District judges reported 98 percent of all pending three-year-old cases, and magistrate judges reported the remaining 2 percent. Three-year-old cases rose in 5 of the 12 circuits and fell in the remaining 7 circuits. The largest increases occurred in the Seventh Circuit, which reported 1,471 more pending cases; the Sixth Circuit, which reported 226 more pending cases; and the Fifth Circuit, which reported 80 more pending cases. In the Seventh Circuit, a single judge reported 1,475 new three-year-old cases related to multidistrict litigation in personal injury cases. In the Sixth Circuit, a single judge reported 401 new multidistrict litigation in personal injury cases related to hip replacements. The Fifth Circuit increase arose from multiple types of three-year-old civil cases.

Appendix B. Definitions
All active and senior district court judges, as well as all full-time and part-time magistrate judges, must report pending matters. For detailed guidelines for making reports under the CJRA on pending motions, bench trials, and cases, see JNet website item http://jnet.ao.dcn/policyguidance/guide-judiciary-policy/volume-18-statistics (Chapter 5 § 540). Several issues relevant to the reporting of cases pending for more than three years include the following.
· With respect to cases pending for more than three years that have been assigned to district judges and magistrate judges from outside the districts where the cases originated, such cases are included in the totals for the districts where they were filed originally. Sometimes a block of cases or a class of cases that are similar in nature is assigned to a single judge. Such cases often require lengthy litigation when they involve complex issues and large numbers of parties.
· This report includes some asbestos cases. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) authorized the transfer of most of the pending asbestos personal injury/product liability cases to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under Order Number 875. Asbestos cases that have remained in the districts where they were filed originally or that were transferred back to the original districts are included in this report. However, those cases transferred according to MDL Order Number 875 are excluded. All other MDL cases are included in this report.
Cases Pending More Than Three Years. The CJRA requires a report, by district judge and magistrate judge, of cases pending more than three years in the district courts. A case becomes pending as of the date the case originally was filed in the district court or the date the case was reopened, whichever is later. If a case has not been disposed of within three years after its filing date or reopening date, the case shall be reported as pending more than three years.
Motions Pending More Than Six Months. The CJRA mandates a report enumerating all motions that have been pending six months or longer. A motion is a request made to a district judge or magistrate judge for an order, ruling, or similar determination. The opposing party has 30 days from the date of a motion's filing to respond to it. A motion becomes pending 30 days after the date it was filed or was referred to a magistrate judge, whichever is later. If no decision on a motion has been filed within six months after the date the motion became pending, and the motion has not been referred to a magistrate judge, the motion shall be reported as pending more than six months before the presiding judge. If a motion is referred to a magistrate judge, the magistrate judge must file a report and make a recommendation for, or dispose of, the motion within six months after the date the motion became pending, or the motion shall be reported as pending for both the district judge and the magistrate judge.
Bench Trials Submitted More than Six Months. The CJRA requires the AO to prepare a report of bench trials submitted more than six months. In a bench trial, the judge (rather than a jury) decides the facts of the case. A bench trial is considered to be submitted on the date the courtroom proceedings are concluded. If a judge fails to file an opinion within six months after a bench trial was submitted, the bench trial shall be reported as submitted more than six months.
65

Bankruptcy Appeals Pending More Than Six Months. In accordance with an action of the March 1998 Judicial Conference, the CJRA now requires a report, by district judge and magistrate judge, of bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months in the district courts. A bankruptcy appeal becomes pending as of the date the appeal originally was filed in the district court or the date the case was reopened, whichever is later. If an appeal has not been disposed of within six months plus 60 days after its filing date or reopening date, the appeal shall be reported as pending more than six months.
Social Security Appeals Pending More Than Six Months. In accordance with an action of the September 1998 Judicial Conference, the CJRA now requires a report, by district judge and magistrate judge, of Social Security appeal cases pending more than six months in the district courts. A Social Security appeal case becomes pending as of the date of the filing of the latest transcript in such case. If a case has not been disposed of within six months plus 120 days after its filing date, the case shall be reported as pending more than six months.
