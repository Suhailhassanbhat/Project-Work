Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990
Report of Motions Pending More Than Six Months, Bench Trials Submitted More Than Six Months, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending More Than Six Months, Social Security Appeal Cases Pending More Than Six Months, and Civil Cases Pending More Than Three Years, on
September 30, 2018
Introduction
The Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 (CJRA) requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO), under 28 U.S.C. § 476, to prepare a semiannual report showing, by U.S. district judge and U.S. magistrate judge, all motions pending more than six months, all bench trials that have remained undecided more than six months, and all civil cases pending more than three years. In accordance with the policy of the Judicial Conference of the United States, this report also presents data on bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months (Rpt. of Proc. of JCUS, Mar. 10, 1998, at 11) and Social Security appeals pending more than six months (Rpt. of Proc. of JCUS, Sept. 15, 1998, at 63). The reporting requirements under the CJRA are designed to help reduce both costs and delays in civil litigation in the district courts. The information also may be used to evaluate demands on the district courts' resources.
The CJRA report is prepared through the use of the Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF) system. As a result, pending motions, bench trials, three-year-old cases, bankruptcy appeals, and Social Security appeals are reported in a standardized and consistent fashion.
Appendix A provides data for each district judge and magistrate judge on motions pending, bench trials submitted, cases pending more than three years, bankruptcy appeals pending, and Social Security appeals pending. The CJRA requires the AO Director to establish uniform standards for determining when a motion, bench trial, case, or bankruptcy appeal is "pending"; Appendix B lists these definitions.
Along with the semiannual consolidated national report, the AO prepares a supplemental report, A Report on Motions Pending for More Than Six Months, Bench Trials Submitted for More Than Six Months, Civil Cases Pending Three Years or More, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending for More Than Six Months, and Social Security Appeals Pending for More Than Six Months, that provides detailed information regarding the individual cases, motions, bench trials, and appeals pending in the district courts. This document is available to the public through the district courts, the executive offices of the U.S. courts of appeals, the AO, and the Federal Judiciary www.uscourts.gov
Report Findings The information in this report presents what may best be described as a "snapshot" of
motions pending more than six months, bench trials submitted more than six months, civil cases pending more than three years, bankruptcy appeals pending more than six months, and Social Security appeals pending more than six months on September 30, 2018. District judge and magistrate judge caseloads change constantly, so many of the matters pending on September 30, 2018, have since been decided or transferred to other
1

judges. Therefore, persons using reports of this type should take into account the state of change in the district courts' pending caseloads. Although the information provided in this report pertains to the pending civil caseload of district judges and magistrate judges, readers should take into consideration the overall case processing demands placed on the courts by both civil and criminal matters. An accurate assessment of the demands placed on the district courts also requires consideration of numerous factors, including vacant judgeships and the effects of all cases making up each court's caseload.
Methodology This national report is designed to place special emphasis on detailed analyses that
are extracted from the national CM/ECF system. Each district court is required to analyze the reasons for delays in disposing of motions, bench trials, three-year-old cases, bankruptcy appeals, and Social Security appeals. Judges use status codes to provide reasons for delays in these matters (see Appendix C). The nature of suit codes for types of civil litigation appear in Appendix D. More specific information about cases pending, motions pending, bench trials submitted, bankruptcy appeals pending, and Social Security appeals pending on March 31, 2018, and September 30, 2018, appears in Tables 1-4.
Numbers of Motions Pending, Bench Trials Submitted, Bankruptcy Appeals Pending, Social Security Appeals and Civil Cases Pending, on September 30, 2018
Motions. The total number of motions pending more than six months for all district judges and magistrate judges remained relatively stable, rising by 3 motions from 5,350 on March 31, 2018, to 5,353 on September 30, 2018. Ninety-two percent of all motions pending were before district judges, and eight percent were before magistrate judges.
For this CJRA report, seven circuits reported increases in pending motions, and five circuits reported decreases. The largest growth in pending motions occurred in the Eleventh Circuit (up 141 motions), District of Columbia Circuit (up 70 motions), Seventh Circuit (up 68 motions), and First Circuit (up 46 motions). Within these circuits, the following districts reported the largest increases in pending motions (in many types of civil cases): the Northern District of Georgia (up 164 motions), the District of Massachusetts (up 59 motions), and the Northern District of Indiana (up 53 motions).
Primary Reasons for Delays in Pending Motions. District courts provided one or more status codes to indicate primary reasons for delays for each of the 5,353 pending motions reported for September 30, 2018. The status codes cited most often were opinion/ decision in draft (1,539 motions), complexity of case (1,104 motions), heavy criminal and civil caseload (930 motions), voluminous briefs/transcripts to be read (743 motions), referred to magistrate judge (312 motions), and awaiting materials (302 motions).
Primary Nature of Suit Codes in Pending Motions. The primary nature of suit codes provided most often by district courts for pending motions were civil rights (1,242 motions), prisoner petitions (945 motions), contract (717 motions), labor (348 motions), other statutory actions (305 motions), and intellectual property rights (295 motions).
Bench Trials. The total number of bench trials pending more than six months for all district judges and magistrate judges remained the same at 63 trials on September 30, 2018. Eighty-six percent of all bench trials submitted were before district judges, and 14 percent were before magistrate judges. Three of the 12 circuits reported growth in pending bench trials, 5 circuits had reductions in pending bench trials, and the totals for 4 circuits remained unchanged.

Endnotes
1 Three-year-old caseload consists of cases related to multidistrict litigation. 2 These cases mostly arise from or relate to the terrorist-related aircraft crashes on September 11, 2001. Except for the cases against Battery Park City, the cases have been settled but have not yet been closed because of the slowness of State and foreign probate courts to approve the settlements for decedents' estates. A batch of cases against Battery Park City Authority, after remand by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals following a decision by the New York Court of Appeals, are in their early phases. 3 Three-year-old caseload includes consolidated cases. 4 Three-year-old caseload consists of mostly cases related to border fence condemnation. 5 Three-year-old caseload consists of primarily of mass tort cases. 6 All telecommunications cases were stayed pending determinations on core issues by the Federal Communications Commission, which were recently completed; the stay is now lifted, and the cases are proceeding.

Appendix B. Definitions
All active and senior district court judges, as well as all full-time and part-time magistrate judges, must report pending matters. Several issues relevant to the reporting of cases pending for more than three years include the following.
· With respect to cases pending for more than three years that have been assigned to district judges and magistrate judges from outside the districts where the cases originated, such cases are included in the totals for the districts where they were filed originally. Sometimes a block of cases or a class of cases that are similar in nature is assigned to a single judge. Such cases often require lengthy litigation when they involve complex issues and large numbers of parties.
· This report includes some asbestos cases. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) authorized the transfer of most of the pending asbestos personal injury/product liability cases to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under Order Number 875. Asbestos cases that have remained in the districts where they were filed originally or that were transferred back to the original districts are included in this report. However, those cases transferred according to MDL Order Number 875 are excluded. All other MDL cases are included in this report.
Cases Pending More Than Three Years. The CJRA requires a report, by district judge and magistrate judge, of cases pending more than three years in the district courts. A case becomes pending as of the date the case originally was filed in the district court or the date the case was reopened, whichever is later. If a case has not been disposed of within three years after its filing date or reopening date, the case shall be reported as pending more than three years.
Motions Pending More Than Six Months. The CJRA mandates a report enumerating all motions that have been pending six months or longer. A motion is a request made to a district judge or magistrate judge for an order, ruling, or similar determination. The opposing party has 30 days from the date of a motion's filing to respond to it. A motion becomes pending 30 days after the date it was filed or was referred to a magistrate judge, whichever is later. If no decision on a motion has been filed within six months after the date the motion became pending, and the motion has not been referred to a magistrate judge, the motion shall be reported as pending more than six months before the presiding judge. If a motion is referred to a magistrate judge, the magistrate judge must file a report and make a recommendation for, or dispose of, the motion within six months after the date the motion became pending, or the motion shall be reported as pending for both the district judge and the magistrate judge.
Bench Trials Submitted More than Six Months. The CJRA requires the AO to prepare a report of bench trials submitted more than six months. In a bench trial, the judge (rather than a jury) decides the facts of the case. A bench trial is considered to be submitted on the date the courtroom proceedings are concluded. If a judge fails to file an opinion within six months after a bench trial was submitted, the bench trial shall be reported as submitted more than six months.
